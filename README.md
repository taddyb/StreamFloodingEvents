# StreamFloodingEvents

### What
Due to recent climate change, it seems the number stream flooding events have been increasing. The goal of this project is to analyze long term stream data from local watersheds of the Hudson river to understand these trends. 

#### Machine Learning 

###### Supervised Machine Learning:
Using the long term data from local watersheds, we will be able to understand and predict events using various supervised machine learning techniques. Since there is a plethora of data, we should be able to hypothesize what varibles are predictors, run k-fold cross validation and various machine learning techniques, then try to make a model which will predict the frequency of storm events.

###### Unsupervised Machine Learning:
Understanding what a flood event is may be the most difficult part of the experiment. Looking from data, it is hard to understand when a stream is flowing below bank full, when it flows above bank full, or what the bank full value is. Using unsupervised machine learning simulations, we can understand what values correspond to bank full, which will then allow us to determine when there are storm/flooding events. 

#### GPU component
Since there are so much data in this study, it is integral to use NVIDIA GPUs to speed up the machine learning processes to come to conclusions quicker. CUDA C interfaces will be how this is addressed.
